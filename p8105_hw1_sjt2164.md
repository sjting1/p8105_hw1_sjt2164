## Question 1

*This question uses the `tidyverse` library and the `Penguins` dataset.
The codes for loading the library and the dataset are hidden using
`include = FALSE`.*

**Summary of Dataset**

The `Penguins` dataset (8 columns x 344 rows), contains data on 344
penguins with the following variables:

- **Factor variables** include `species` (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo),
  `island` (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), `year` (2007 - 2009), and `sex`
  (female, male).
- **Numeric variables** include doubles (`bill_length_mm` and
  `bill_depth_mm`) and integers (`body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`).

Using the `summary(penguins)` code, we also see that there are several
“NA” values in the dataset. Each of the numberic variables listed above
had 2 NA values. 11 of the 344 penguins had NA values for `sex`.

Body mass is measured in grams and ranges from 2700g to 6300g with a
mean of 4201.75g. Bill length (min: 32.1, max: 59.6, mean: 43.92), bill
depth (min: 13.1, max: 21.5, mean: 17.15), and flipper length (min: 172,
max: 231, mean: 200.92) are all measured in millimeters.

**Penguins Scatterplot**

*Note: The code, messages, and any warning notices are hidden using
`echo = FALSE`, `message = FALSE`, and `warning = FALSE`. Only the
scatterplot is shown below.*

Using the `Penguins` dataset, a scatterplot is generated below using
`ggplot() + geom_point()`. The distribution of penguin species is shown
bellow with `flipper_length_mm` as the y-variable and `bill_length_mm`
as the x-variable. Each penguin species is represented by a different
color as depicted in the key of the scatterplot.

Since 2 penguins had “NA” values for both `flipper_length_mm` and
`bill_length_mm`, they are excluded. Thus, the scatterplot contains data
for a total of 342 penguins.

The scatterplot is exported using `ggsave`.

## Question 2

The code below shows how the data frame `question2_df` is constructed.
This data frame consists of the following variables:

- `sample_value` (*double*) = a random sample of size 10 from a standard
  Normal distribution
- `value_greater_than_0` (*character*) = a logical vector that indicates
  whether elements of `sample_value` are greater than 0
- `nycity_names` (*character*) = a character vector of length 10
- `top_industries` (*factor*) = a factor vector of length 10 containing
  3 levels (`entertainment`, `healthcare`, and `technology`).

``` r
question2_df = 
    tibble(
      sample_value = rnorm(10),
      value_greater_than_0 = ifelse(sample_value > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
      nycity_names = c("Nyc", "Buffalo", "Rochester", "Yonkers", "Syracuse", "Albany", "New Rochelle", "Schenectady", "Utica", "Mount_Vernon"),
      top_industries = factor(c("entertainment", "healthcare", "technology", "healthcare", "healthcare", "healthcare", "technology", "technology", "technology", "healthcare"))
    )
```

**Taking the Mean**

Using the `pull` function to take the mean of the variables in the
`question2_df` data frame, we get:

- `sample_value` = -0.1595173
- `value_greater_than_0` = 0.5
- `nycity_names` = NA
- `top_industries` = NA

As shown above, the mean of `sample_value` and `value_greater_than_0`
can be calculated. `sample_value` is a double and thus, mean can be
calcuated. We can also calculate the mean of `value_greater_than_0`
because TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in logical vectors. However, the mean
cannot be calculated for the remaining 2 variables: `nycity_names`
(character) and `top_industries` (factor).

**Converting Variable Types**

The code below shows an attempt to convert the logical, character, and
factor variables using the function `as.numeric`. The output of the
codes below are hidden using `eval = FALSE`.

``` r
q2_df_updated = 
  question2_df|>
    mutate(
      over_zero = as.numeric(value_greater_than_0),
      names_updated = as.numeric(nycity_names),
      indus_updated = as.numeric(top_industries)
    )
```

After running the code above as well as `view(q2_df_updated)` in the
console, we see that values for `names_updated` are all “NA”. This is
reflected in the warning messages in `mutate()`. The character vector
cannot be converted using `as.numeric` because of “NAs introduced by
coercion”. On the other hand, the values for `indus_updated` and
`over_zero` were both converted into numbers.

**Mean Calculations after Conversion Attempt**

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df_updated,over_zero))
mean(pull(q2_df_updated,names_updated))
mean(pull(q2_df_updated,indus_updated))
```

Running the above code chunk, we find that the mean of `indus_updated`
and `over_zero` can be calculated. Since NAs were introduced for
`names_updated`, this explains why we are still unable to calculate the
mean after attempting to convert the variable with the `as.numeric`
function.
