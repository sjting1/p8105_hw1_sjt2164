### Question 1

*This question uses the `tidyverse` library and the `Penguins` dataset.
The codes for loading the library and the dataset are hidden using
`include = FALSE` for easier reading.*

**Summary of Dataset**

The `Penguins` dataset (8 columns x 344 rows), contains data on 344
penguins with the following variables:

- **Factor variables** include `species` (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo),
  `island` (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), `year` (2007 - 2009), and `sex`
  (female, male).
- **Numeric variables** include doubles (`bill_length_mm` and
  `bill_depth_mm`) and integers (`body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`).

Using the `summary(penguins)` code, we also see that there are several
“NA” values in the dataset. Each of the numberic variables listed above
had 2 NA values. 11 of the 344 penguins had NA values for `sex`.

Body mass is measured in grams and ranges from 2700g to 6300g with a
mean of 4201.75g. Bill length (min: 32.1, max: 59.6, mean: 43.92), bill
depth (min: 13.1, max: 21.5, mean: 17.15), and flipper length (min: 172,
max: 231, mean: 200.92) are all measured in millimeters.
